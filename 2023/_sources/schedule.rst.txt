Schedule overview
-----------------

The workshop formally runs August 28â€“30, and, depending on interest, we can cover more topics or work with student data sets August 31 and September 1. The topics list will depend on our interactions with each other as we get a feel for the background and needs of the students. I we manage to cover *everything* (we won't), the times below are approximate for the lessons and exercises we will do.

Additional topics that may be interesting to students include null hypothesis significance overplotting, dashboarding, testing (NHST), principled workflows, advanced bootstrapping techniques (BCa, Studentization), and Bayesian modeling (including hierarchical modeling).
